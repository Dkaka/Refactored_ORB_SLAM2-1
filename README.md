# Refactored_ORB_SLAM2

This is a refactoring of the ORB_SLAM2 repository. It uses up-to-date cmake, up-to-date DBoW2 and g2o libraries, supports all static and all dynamic libraries (for debugging) and 2011 era C++ for sleep, threads, namespaces, etc.

You should be able to build by running:

./Build_ThirdParty.sh
./Build.sh
